# hobby-log

____________________________________________________________
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This project was inspired by a recent conversation with my best friend. During out conversation, we decided that we wanted to earn new hobbies in our life, strictly related to things that we enjoyed doing.. and add more meaning, color to our life. There are so many things we devote our time to, every day, but those are things that we "need" to do. Now, it's time to focus on what we wanted to do. In this app, users will be able to embark on a journey towards a gaining a new hobby in their life. Users will be able to document their journey and share with other users if they choose to do so. The user will also have a private to-do list with one important feature: each item in the to-do list will also have a realistic but condensed deadline that they're required to fill out when creating the item. Parkinson's Law states that "work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion." Including a required deadline/timer feature for the to-do list will help in increasing the user's productivity according to this law. This feature will not be a deadline such as "complete this to-do by this date and time" but more of a "this to-do will require 30 minutes to complete."
